<h1>Some good fillums</h1>
<h2>A list of films I have seen and liked.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>One of the best films of all time.<br /><br /> 5/5</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>Great music, great effects, solid hero's journey. Some clunky dialogue 
   is pretty much only flaw.<br /><br /> 4.75/5</p>
<h3>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</h3>
<p>Great music, great pacing, absolute classic.<br /><br /> 5/5</p>
